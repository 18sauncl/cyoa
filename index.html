    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This adventure is about finding your way though the sky at night (and day!) The very first astrologers wanted to pick a constellation to represent each time of the year. They wanted the constellations to represent the qualities of each month. So, they chose the stars that the sun shines through during the day in each month. Therefor, the Zodiac constellations can't be seen at night in the months they represent. They can only be seen in the night sky at the opposite times of the year. </p>
    <p>Make sure you name each Zodiac constellation correctly if you want to make it to the end!</p>
