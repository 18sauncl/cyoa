    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This adventure is about finding your way though the sky at night (and day!) The very first astrologers wanted a different constellation to represent each time of the year, and they wanted the constellations to symbolize the qualities of each month. Instead of picking the stars they saw at night each month, they chose the stars that the sun shines through during the day, and therefore can't be seen. Because of this, the Zodiac constellations can't be seen at night in the months they represent. They can only be seen at night during the opposite times of the year.  Your task is to guess which Zodiac constellation represents each part of the year.</p>
    <p>Make sure you name each Zodiac constellation correctly if you want to make it to the end!</p>
