    <p>Summer Milky Way preview: For much of every spring at mid-northern latitudes, the Milky Way lies right down all around the horizon after dark, completely out of sight. But as evening grows late, watch low in the east to northeast. There the rich Cygnus stretch of the Milky Way now starts rising into view by around 10 or 11 p.m.  It will rise earlier and higher every week.</p>
