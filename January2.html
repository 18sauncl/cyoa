    <p> Aquarius is a rather faint constellation which would not be famous if it weren't part of the Zodiac. Aquarius, as its name suggests is universally associated with water.

This may arise from the fact that the Sun enters Aquarius in early winter when the rainy season begins in many parts of the world. </p>
