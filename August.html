    <h1>August</h1>
    <p>August is prime Milky Way time, and the dark night is now moonless. After dark the Milky Way runs from Sagittarius in the south, up and left across Aquila and through the big Summer Triangle very high in the east, and on down through Cassiopeia to Perseus rising low in the north-northeast.</p>
