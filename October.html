    <h1>October</h1>
    <p>This is the time of year when the Big Dipper lies down horizontal low in the north-northwest after dark. How low? The farther south you are, the lower. Seen from 40° north (New York, Denver) even its bottom stars twinkle nearly ten degrees high. But at Miami (26° N) the entire Dipper skims along out of sight just below the northern horizon.</p>
    <p> Which Zodiac constellation do you think the sun shines through during the day at this time of the year? </p>
