    <p>As the stars come out, face due north and look high. Cassiopeia is now a flattened "M" canted at about a 45Â° angle (depending on where you live). Hardly more than an hour later, the M has turned horizontal. Constellations passing near the zenith appear to rotate rapidly with respect to the direction "up."</p>
